<h1>Sequences, Time Series and Prediction</h1>

<h2>C4W1_Assignment: Working with time series</h2>
<p>In this assignment, all of the data will be generated, and several functions will be implemented to split the data, create forecasts, and evaluate the quality of those forecasts.</p>

<h2>C4W2_Assignment:  Forecasting Using Neural Networks</h2>
<p>In this assignment, all of the data will be generated.</p>
<code>A neural network capable of forecasting time series was implemented, and Tensorflow's Dataset class was leveraged to process time series data.</code>

<h2>C4W3_Assignment: Forecast using RNNs or LSTMs</h2>
<p>In this assignment, all of the data will be generated.</p>
<code>A neural network capable of forecasting time series was implemented, and Tensorflow's layers were leveraged for sequence modeling, such as RNNs and LSTMs.</code>

<h2>C4W4_Assignment:  Adding CNNs to improve forecasts</h2>
<p>In this assignment, the Daily Minimum Temperatures in Melbourne dataset used which is containing data of the daily minimum temperatures recorded in Melbourne from 1981 to 1990.</p>
<code>A neural network capable of forecasting time series was implemented, leveraging a combination of Tensorflow's layers, including Convolutional and LSTMs, for processing sequence data</code>
